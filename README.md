## mote-models

Intended to be a simple data modeling library with immutability built-in.

It is inspired by Ruby's ActiveModel, though much fewer features.

### Installation

```
npm i -S mote-models
```

Note: lodash 4.17.x is a peer dependency. So make sure to include it in your application's dependencies.

### API

See the included `User` model for a sample implementation of a model and its attributes.
